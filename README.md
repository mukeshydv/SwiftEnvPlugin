# SwiftEnvPlugin

SwiftEnvPlugin is a Swift Package Manager (SPM) build tool plugin designed to generate a constants file (`SwiftEnv.swift`) automatically based on environment variables. This tool helps developers manage environment-specific configurations efficiently within Swift projects. ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ

---

## Features ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ

- Automatically generates a Swift file containing constants for environment variables. âœ¨
- Simplifies managing environment-specific values in Swift projects. âœ¨
- Fully integrates with Swift Package Manager's plugin system. âœ¨

---

## Installation ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ

### Add the Plugin to Your Project

To use `SwiftEnvPlugin`, include it in your `Package.swift` file: ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.7
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YourProject",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/mukeshydv/SwiftEnvPlugin.git", from: "1.0.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "YourTarget",
            plugins: [
                .plugin(name: "SwiftEnvPlugin", package: "SwiftEnvPlugin")
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```

### Add a `swiftenv.json` File

Create a `swiftenv.json` file in the root of your project. This file defines the environment variables you want to include in the generated Swift code. Each key in the JSON file represents the name of the Swift variable, and its value is the corresponding environment variable name. ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ

#### Example `swiftenv.json`

```json
{
    "apiKey": "MY_API_KEY",
    "baseUrl": "MY_BASE_URL"
}
```

In this example:
- `apiKey` will be set to the value of the `MY_API_KEY` environment variable. âœ¨
- `baseUrl` will be set to the value of the `MY_BASE_URL` environment variable. âœ¨

---

## Usage ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ

### Build and Generate Constants

When you build your project using `swift build` or Xcode, the plugin will: ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ

1. Read the `swiftenv.json` file.
2. Fetch the values of the specified environment variables.
3. Generate a `SwiftEnv.swift` file in the build directory.
4. Include the generated file in your build process.

### Access Generated Constants

In your Swift code, import the generated file and use the constants: ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ

```swift
import Foundation

let apiKey = SwiftEnv.apiKey
print("API Key: \(apiKey)")
```

### Example Generated File

```swift
// SwiftEnv.swift

enum SwiftEnv {
    static let apiKey = "your_api_key"
    static let baseUrl = "https://example.com"
}
```

---

## Development ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ

### How It Works

1. The plugin reads the `swiftenv.json` file to determine the mapping of Swift variable names to environment variable names. âœ¨
2. It fetches the environment variable values during the build process. âœ¨
3. It generates a `SwiftEnv.swift` file in a predefined directory. âœ¨
